# Project #3: Building Your Full-stack Application on Rails

### Overview

This third project is your first foray into **building a full-stack application on Rails**. This time **we’re going to challenge you to work on a whole project with a small team.**

Not only will you be asked to **exercise additional creativity** in designing your own project, you will partner with your classmate(s) to architect, design, and collaboratively build an application (and API) of your own design.

This time you will have to use Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL database as the backend in your application and use JavaScript, HTML ,CSS in your frontend.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** It’s a lot harder to work in a team than to work by yourself, but that's most likely you’re going to find yourself doing in your first development job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 3 models** (more if they make sense) – one representing a User of your application, and two that represents the main functional idea for your app. Models should be related to each other.
* **Include sign up/log in/log out functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
* **Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure** and interact with your relationally-stored data
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
* **Have a [Responsive Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)**, we recommend you start `mobile-first` and then build up for larger screen sizes!
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public

### Necessary Deliverables

* **User Stories**, in [Pivotal tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/)
* A **working full-stack application, built by your team**, hosted somewhere on the internet (heroku)
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
  * A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
  * **`readme.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* A **Entity/Relationship Diagram ([ERD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model))**
* **Wireframes of your app**, done with [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) & distributed specs with [zeplin](https://zeplin.io/)
* A **presentation**, done with [slides.com](http://www.slides.com)

### More Rules / Reminders

* **Read the Rails guides** : In fact you should read them **BEFORE** you start your project. But they are good references any how.
* **Google is your friend (OR seek and ye shall find)** : Seriously, given the popularity of the Rails framework, most of the problems a newbie will face have **ALREADY** been faced by millions other newbies. So, just google whatever cryptic error messages you found and usually the top links from the search will have the answer you seek.
* **Use Debug Messages, PLEASE** : If you found yourself staring at the screen for 10 minutes without any clue why your program is breaking, you should start adding more `console.log`, `puts` or `p` statements in your code to trace your program. If you don't do this first, **DO NOT** expect any help from Denis or Willie (especially Willie).
* **Debug First, Ask Questions Later** : Before you ask Denis and Willie to solve your problems, do some debugging on your own first. Look at the Rais error logs (usually very programmer-friendly), add debug messages, **think** about where did the errors happen (front- or back-end?). If the answer is staring right **AT** you on the screen, **DO NOT** expect any help from Denis or Willie (especially Willie).
* **Make Feature Branches** : Avoid pushing changes to the `master` branch directly especially you are working as a team this time. Use a feature branch to track your changes and submit pull requests to the master branch so that your partner (and Denis/Willie) can review them.
* **Use DB Migrations WISELY**: Avoid going back in time to update previous DB Migrations.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems**.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what ot build.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Cheerups
The world is a depressing place.

Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "cheerups" - happy little quips to brighten other peoples' days. Cheerups will be small - limited to 139 characters. Members will be able to promote Cheerups that they like and maybe even boost the reputation of the Cheerupper.

##### Bookmarket
You will create an application where users can bookmark links they want to keep.

But what if users could trade bookmarks for other bookmarks? Or sell bookmarks for points? Or send bookmarks to your friends. Or something even crazier.

##### Photo sharing app
Users will be able to register and create albums and photos. Albums and photos will need to be named and described by their owners. Users will be able to view other users' albums. Maybe users can comment on photos, or either up/down vote them.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Deployment and Functionality__: Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
