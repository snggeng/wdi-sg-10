No, it does not mean you can steal someone's code and claim them as your own. It means you can learn a lot from reading (good) code by *stealing* the idea, not just by *copying* (borrowing) the actual code.

Believe it or not, to be a good programmer, you need to read as much code as you are going to write them. The reason is that reading other (good) programmers' code is the best way to learn new technique and new ways to model your ideas.

You will be meeting with one of the instructional team (either an instructor or a TA) and here are some things to think about while you're waiting for your turn:
- 1 thing that is good about your code
- 1 thing that can be improved
- 2 things which puzzle you in the code and that you would like explained

Criteria:
- Is the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) enough?
- Is the code too complex? Is there an easier way to do that?
- Indentation
- Naming of functions and variables: are they meaningful or confusing?
- Correct usage of jQuery event listeners (e.g. are there any multiple listeners unecessarily defined for the same event)
- Any nice programming technique you want to highlight?
- ... etc
